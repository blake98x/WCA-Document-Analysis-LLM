# WCA LangChain Model

## Context:

The WCA is a global and volunteer-driven organization that “governs competitions for mechanical puzzles that are operated by twisting groups of pieces, commonly known as 'twisty puzzles’” [[1](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/about)]. As the organization has evolved through expanding its global footprint and spreading the unique passion of solving Rubik’s Cubes, it has needed to adapt to the intricacies of such dramatic growth. With its volunteer base stemming from such a variety of backgrounds, there has been need to establish regulations, policies, and guidelines. 

While these documents help to ensure that the variety of Delegates abide by and enforce the same standards across the globe, the sheer quantity/depth of them along with the language barriers that exist within the organization make understanding the depth of these documents a remarkably difficult task.

The tool developed here seeks to allow for quick responses primarily for the following documents:

1. WCA Regulations
2. WCA Guidelines
3. WCA Bylaws
4. WCA Motions
5. WCA Code of Conduct
6. WCA Vision and Strategy
7. WCA Minutes
8. WCA Financial Reports
9. WCA Competition Requirements Policy
10. WCA Dues System
11. WCA Equipment Funding Policy
12. WCA Logo Usage Policy
13. WCA Regional Organization Support Policy
14. WCA Scramble Accountability Policy
15. WCA Travel Reimbursement Policy
